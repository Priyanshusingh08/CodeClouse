Project 1

----- Time Conversion by Country -----

# TimeConversion

In this project, I use the `LocalTime`, `DateTimeFormatter`, `Scanner`, `ZoneId`, `ZonedDateTime`, and `LocalDate` classes from the `java.time` package to perform the time conversion. The `DateTimeFormatter` is used to parse and format the time in the specified format (`HH:mm`).

The application prompts the user to enter the local time, source time zone, and target time zone. It then converts the local time from the source time zone to the target time zone and prints the converted time.

You can compile and run this Java program to test it out. Make sure you have Java 8 or a higher version installed on your system.
